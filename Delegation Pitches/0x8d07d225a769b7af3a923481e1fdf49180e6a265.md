Hi Folx,

I've been hanging around the DeFi space and participating in governance for the past few months, primarily in MakerDAO and Compound governance, but also with a few other projects.

You can find me on discourse forums as [@monet-supply](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/monet-supply) and on [twitter](https://twitter.com/MonetSupply). You can also review my voting history with Compound [here](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0x8d07d225a769b7af3a923481e1fdf49180e6a265) to see if our governance philosophies align.

My commitments as a delegate:

-   12+ hrs advanced notice before I submit votes, giving time to un-delegate your stake if you disagree
-   100% vote participation

Cheers and happy voting!
